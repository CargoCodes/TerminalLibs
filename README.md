# TerminalLibs
Terminal Libraries: same library, for different languages

Libraries:
- [TerminalPyth](https://github.com/CargoCodes/TerminalPyth)
- [TerminalCplusplus](https://github.com/CargoCodes/TerminalCplusplus)

`Description`:

Library that allows you to call terminal commands whithout discarding directory changes (unlike built-in terminal services do).

Two clones of the same library, one for Python, one for C++. They work the exact same way, check out documentation and codes on the links above.
